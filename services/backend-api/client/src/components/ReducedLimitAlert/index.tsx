              Due to the unsustainably increasing cost of running this service, free tier benefits
              have unfortunately been scaled back on 1 May 2025 as feeds on the free tier account
              for the overwhelming majority of the load.
              <br /> <br />
              <UnorderedList>
                <ListItem>
                  The number of feeds available on the free tier have been reduced from 5 to 3.
                  Feeds over this limit will be disabled until you remove some feeds or upgrade.
                </ListItem>
                <ListItem>
                  The refresh rate on the free tier have been increased from 10 minutes to 20
                  minutes.
                </ListItem>
              </UnorderedList>
              <br />
              You may attempt to reduce your number of feeds by using third-party RSS feed
              combiners/aggregators to combine multiple RSS feeds into one.
              <br />
              <br />
              While these changes are unfortunate, they are necessary to facilitate contiued free
              usage of this open-source service. If you would like to support the service, consider
              becoming a supporter by upgrading to a paid plan. Thank you for your continued
              support.
